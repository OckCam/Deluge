# Deluge
Zoho Deluge Scripts and Concept

The objective is to learn Deluge, and at the same time, share my learnings. We operate a WooCommerce online store, use WooCommerce as a quick fit delivery task management (dispatch, tracking and billing), and our financials are all in Zoho Books. The script snippets are all used in production, and enhanced as I gain more confidence with the language and the concepts.
